# How to Use Caterpillar ET Software to Generate Factory Passwords
 
Caterpillar ET Software is a diagnostic tool that allows you to access and modify various parameters of Caterpillar machines, engines, and equipment. However, some parameters are protected by factory passwords, which are required to prevent unauthorized changes. Factory passwords are also needed to clear any event codes or disable certain features, such as the immobilizer or the machine security system.

Factory passwords are not easy to obtain, as they are part of a security system that helps to prevent unauthorized reprogramming of certain parameters. Factory passwords are generated based on the following information[^1^]:
 
- Serial Number of the ECM
- Engine Serial Number
- Serial Number for Cat ET
- Reason Code
- Total Tattletale Number

In order to obtain the proper factory passwords, you need to contact an authorized Caterpillar dealer and provide them with this information. Alternatively, you can use a Caterpillar Factory Password Generator tool, which works with any version of Cat ET and can generate 10-digit factory passwords for any Caterpillar machine, engine, or equipment[^2^]. This tool can help you access and modify customer password-protected parameters without divulging the actual customer passwords, which may be the same for an entire fleet.
 
To use the Caterpillar Factory Password Generator tool, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download and install the tool on your computer. You can purchase it online from various websites[^3^]. Make sure it is compatible with your version of Cat ET and your operating system.
2. Connect your computer to the ECM of the Caterpillar machine, engine, or equipment using a communication adapter.
3. Launch Cat ET and select the parameter you want to change or view. If it is protected by a factory password, you will see a dialog box asking you to enter the password.
4. Launch the Caterpillar Factory Password Generator tool and enter the information displayed on the dialog box: Serial Number of the ECM, Engine Serial Number, Serial Number for Cat ET, Reason Code, and Total Tattletale Number.
5. Click on Generate Password and wait for a few seconds. The tool will generate a 10-digit factory password that you can use to access or modify the parameter.
6. Enter the factory password on the dialog box and click OK. You should be able to view or change the parameter as desired.

Note that the factory passwords generated by this tool are valid for one programming session only. If you want to access or modify another parameter that requires a factory password, you need to generate a new one using the same steps.
